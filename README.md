TIME SERIES ANALYSIS AND FORCASTING
walk forward validation -
Walk Forward Validation was originally discussed by Robert E. Pardo. One of the primary benefits of Walk-Forward Validation as mentioned by Pardo, is to determine the robustness of the trading strategy. The central and highest benefit of the Walk-Forward Validation is to determine the degree of confidence with which the trader may anticipate that the strategy will perform in real-time trading as it has in its historical testing.
sklearn metrices-
Sklearn metrics let you assess the quality of your predictions. You can use this module in Scikit-Learn for various datasets, score functions, and performance metrics. The confusion matrix in sklearn is a handy representation of the accuracy of predictions.
mse-
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) of an estimator measures the average of error squares i.e. the average squared difference between the estimated values and true value. It is a risk function, corresponding to the expected value of the squared error loss. It is always non – negative and values close to zero are better. The MSE is the second moment of the error (about the origin) and thus incorporates both the variance of the estimator and its bias.
ar vs lr-
Autoregression modeling is a modeling technique used for time series data that assumes linear continuation of the series so that previous values in the time series can be used to predict futures values.  Some of you may be thinking that this sounds just like a linear regression – it sure does sound that way and is – in general – the same idea with additional features of the model that includes the idea of ‘lag variables’
